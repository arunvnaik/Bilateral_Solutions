1. Check the Product Inventory 

SELECT product_id, product_name, stock_quantity
FROM inventory
WHERE product_id = <PRODUCT_ID>;


2. Verify the Customer's Order 

SELECT order_id, customer_id, product_id, order_quantity, order_status
FROM orders
WHERE customer_id = <CUSTOMER_ID>
AND product_id = <PRODUCT_ID>;


3. Check Recent Orders for the Product 

SELECT order_id, customer_id, product_id, order_quantity, order_date
FROM orders
WHERE product_id = <PRODUCT_ID>
AND order_status = 'completed'
ORDER BY order_date DESC;


4. Verify Inventory Updates 

SELECT inventory_id, product_id, change_quantity, change_type, change_date
FROM inventory_changes
WHERE product_id = <PRODUCT_ID>
ORDER BY change_date DESC;


5. Check for Order Cancellations 

SELECT order_id, product_id, order_quantity, order_status, update_date
FROM orders
WHERE product_id = <PRODUCT_ID>
AND order_status = 'cancelled'
ORDER BY update_date DESC;

6. Check for Inconsistencies or Errors 

SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE product_id = <PRODUCT_ID>
AND order_status NOT IN ('completed', 'cancelled', 'pending');

SELECT *
FROM inventory
WHERE product_id = <PRODUCT_ID>
AND stock_quantity < 0;
